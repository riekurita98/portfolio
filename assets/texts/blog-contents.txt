After the Ohsanami, I went to a cafe in Denenchofu with my mom where she recommended. They had traditional French menu and galettes looked super delicious. We got Nicoise salad and Ham and Cheese Galette. It came with big plates full with the delicious cuisines so we were really happy about the time there. The place was a little like a cottage and from the second floor, the view of the cherry blossoms was perfect.

I went this bar called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/baro.daikanyama/?hl=ja">Baro</a> in Daikanyama with my sister. It was a small and nice bar and we were excited to have oeuf mayonnaise which was their speciality but those were already sold out when we get there. We still got really dealicious chicken dumpling, lamb-burg, fig and noir pate, scallop confit with very tasty wine paring that the sommelier chose for us. I got orange wine and I really liked it. The server was very friendly and introduced the sister stores next door and in Onomichi, which I would really like to try sometime.
